All resources are billed hourly at a fixed rate. For the latest information on the currently supported service tiers, compute sizes, and storage amounts, see [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/postgresql/server/) You can dynamically adjust service tiers and compute sizes to match your application\\\\u0027s varied throughput needs. You\\\\u0027re billed for outgoing Internet traffic at regular [data transfer rates](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/data-transfers/).\\\\nWith Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server, Microsoft automatically configures, patches, and upgrades the database software. These automated actions reduce your administration costs. Also, Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server has automated backup-link capabilities. These capabilities help you achieve significant cost savings, especially when you have a large number of databases. In contrast, with PostgreSQL on Azure VMs you can choose and run any PostgreSQL version. However, you need to pay for the provisioned VM, storage cost associated with the data, backup, monitoring data and log storage and the costs for the specific PostgreSQL license type used (if any).\\\\nAzure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server provides built-in high availability at the zonal-level (within an AZ) for any kind of node-level interruption while still maintaining the [SLA guarantee](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/postgresql/v1_2/) for the service. Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server provides [uptime SLAs](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/postgresql/v1_2/) with and without zone-redundant configuration. However, for database high availability within VMs, you use the high availability options like [Streaming Replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/warm-standby.html#STREAMING-REPLICATION) that are available on a PostgreSQL database. Using a supported high availability option doesn\\\\u0027t provide another SLA. But it does let you achieve greater than 99.99% database availability at more cost and administrative overhead.\\\\nFor more information on pricing, see the following articles:\\\\n1.

Use reserved capacity pricing\\\\nAzure Postgres reserved capacity pricing allows committing to a specific capacity for **1-3** **years**, saving costs for customers using Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server. The cost savings compared to pay-as-you-go pricing can be significant, depending on the amount of capacity reserved and the length of the term. Customers can purchase reserved capacity in increments of vCores and storage. Reserved capacity can cover costs for Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server instances in the same region, applied to the customer\\\\u0027s Azure subscription. Reserved pricing for Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server offers cost savings up to 40% for 1 year and up to 60% for 3-year commitments, for customers who reserve capacity.
